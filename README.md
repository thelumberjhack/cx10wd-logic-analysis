# CX10-WD RF Communication protocol analysis
These are unfinished sources/notes about the drone RE project I did back in 2017
and presented at BSides Vancouver in March 2017. Provided as is for anyone to
re-use it.
It contains python code to analyze traces dumped using the Saleae Logic Pro 8
device, data sheets about the XN297 chip, pictures and board settings.
